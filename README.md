# Trifecta
This is a 3 game compilation made using Pygame.
Need to have pygame, pyper and pygame-chess modules installed in order to make  all the components of the project work.
pyper and pygame-chess are required for the chess game only.
Make sure that the main menu files and resources are in the same directory.
